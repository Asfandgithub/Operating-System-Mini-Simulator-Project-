Mini Operating System Simulator

Mini Operating System Simulator is a C++ project designed to demonstrate core operating system concepts in an educational environment. It simulates process management, CPU scheduling, synchronization, and safe resource allocation.

Processes are represented using Process Control Blocks (PCB), and their execution is managed through a producer–consumer model with multithreading. The simulator ensures deadlock prevention using Banker’s Algorithm and maintains proper synchronization using std::mutex and std::condition_variable.

The project includes a menu-driven interface for manual process creation, monitoring ready/blocked queues, and starting the simulation. It is a practical tool for learning how operating systems handle concurrent processes and resource management safely.

Future extensions can include advanced scheduling algorithms, graphical visualization, and real-time OS features.
